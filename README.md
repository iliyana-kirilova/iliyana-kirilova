<p align="left">🐾 My Journey:<br>In June 2024, my life took an unexpected turn when I was diagnosed with cancer after being found with a tumor. After undergoing 3 surgeries and a couple of chemotherapies, I began my recovery journey—and with it, I discovered a new passion: coding. 💻<br>What started as a way to keep my mind active during recovery turned into a full-blown love for programming.</p>

###

<p align="left">🎓 Currently Studying:<br>I'm a Java and Python enthusiast, currently studying at SoftUni. My goal is to develop software solutions for divers, marine professionals, and ship automation. I welcome collaborations with those who share my passion for tech and innovation!  I challenge you to connect and create something impactful together! 🤝</p>
